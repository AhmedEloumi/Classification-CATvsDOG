Image Classification with Keras, Tensorflow | Cat Vs Dog Prediction | Convolution Neural Networks

we will be learning how to preprocess image data to feed into the neural nets. 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) form the basis of all image processing. It is also applied in Face Recognition. In this video, we will talk about all the image operations using Python Libraries like OpenCV, keras, TensorFlow, numpy etc.
